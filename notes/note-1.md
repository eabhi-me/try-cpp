In C++, a vector is a dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size. It is part of the Standard Template Library (STL) and is defined in the `<vector>` header.

Here are some key details about vectors in C++:
- Vectors can store elements of any data type, including built-in types (int, float, etc.) and user-defined types (classes, structures, etc.).
- Vectors automatically manage the memory for their elements, allowing for easy resizing and efficient memory usage.
- Elements in a vector are stored contiguously in memory, allowing for efficient random access.
- Vectors provide various methods to manipulate and access their elements, such as `push_back()`, `pop_back()`, `size()`, `at()`, and more.
- Vectors can be initialized with an initial size and/or default values using the constructor or the `resize()` method.

Here's an example of creating and using a vector in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

int main() {
    // Creating an empty vector
    std::vector<int> numbers;

    // Adding elements to the vector
    numbers.push_back(10);
    numbers.push_back(20);
    numbers.push_back(30);

    // Accessing elements using the [] operator
    int firstElement = numbers[0];
    int secondElement = numbers[1];

    // Accessing elements using the at() method
    int thirdElement = numbers.at(2);

    // Getting the size of the vector
    int size = numbers.size();

    // Removing the last element
    numbers.pop_back();

    // Resizing the vector
    numbers.resize(2);

    return 0;
}
```
